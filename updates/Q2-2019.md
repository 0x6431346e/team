# AragonMesh Q2 Update

For those unfamiliar with the project, the aragonCLI is a tool used to develop Aragon apps, and to interact with DAOs (create, install apps, etc.). In April we've received a Nest grant to actively maintain the project and to plan for its development.

Our mission is to improve developer experience and to provide power users with an easier way of [customizing DAOs](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/guides-custom-deploy) without having to interact directly with the blockchain or to wait until the Graphical UI is fully-featured.

Initially this implied offering support to developers in setting up their environment, publishing apps, etc. This allowed us to prioritize bugs that prevent people from continuing their work and to add features that bring them the most value short-term.

## What has changed

We have achieved a couple of milestones in regards to maintenance, which will free some of our bandwidth and which we hope that will enable a large number of contributors to get along:

- A monorepo structure
- Continuous integration
- Continuous deployment & a better changelog
- Unit & integration testing
- End-to-end testing
- Code coverage
- Automated dependency management
- Issue templates
- Code formatting
- Documentation on reviewing, testing, and releasing
- Updated API documentation & new guides
- Updated deployments of Aragon to the dev chain
- A `nightly` pipeline for users that value the latest updates & features
- A `stable` pipeline for users that value stability
- A single source of truth for API docs

Along the way we are also figuring out what are the best practices for developing:

- CLI tools
- JavaScript projects
- Community-driven projects

And, in a true web3 spirit, we've been documenting most of these [in our repository](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/tree/master/docs-internal).  
Note: these are *very* early drafts that require a couple more iterations, but we are confident that soon, we will be onboarding new contributors in no time.

As far as new features go, the most noteworthy would be:

- [`aragon dao act`](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-dao-commands#dao-act)
- [`aragon apm info`](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-apm-commands#aragon-apm-info)
- [`aragon apm packages`](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-apm-commands#aragon-apm-packages)
- [`aragon ipfs propagate`](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-ipfs-commands#aragon-ipfs-propagate)
- [`aragon ipfs view`](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-ipfs-commands#aragon-ipfs-view)
- [`create-aragon-app`](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro.html#create-aragon-app)

A lot of this work (if not most) has been done by the wider Aragon community and facilitated by us. A big thank you to everyone participating in this project!!!

And a special thanks to @sohkai who has been giving us a lot of valuable feedback along the way!!

## Challenges so far

One of the recurring issues people have with the CLI is that they cannot install it or that it stops working unexpectedly. This is often due to external dependencies and because "we" (the maintainers and Aragon community) don't install the CLI all the time, the first people to notice are new users. This is a terrible first experience, and people often think that it's their wrongdoing and become discouraged.

To tackle this, we wanted to set up end-to-end testing. We initially considered `sharness` because the [ipfs folks are using it](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-sharness-tests),but after some time [decided to drop it](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/pull/363#discussion_r258937221) due to shell scripting being difficult to learn and very time-consuming (as compared to node). As far as `node` frameworks go, we tried `nixt` and [dropped it](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/pull/390#discussion_r261824980), favoring a few [utilities](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/blob/master/packages/e2e-tests/src/util.js) we wrote that do the job well.

We also faced a few challenges when dealing with dependencies, lockfiles, monorepos or mocking dependencies in tests. If we can help you with any of these please reach out or check our internal docs! üëã

## What is next

Being almost in a place where the aragonCLI is a stable and reliable tool, we will soon shift our efforts towards:

- the [product spec](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/blob/master/docs-internal/next/Specification.md), a place with current and future use cases
- a scalable architecture that allows people to [extend it](https://forum.aragon.org/t/aragoncli-extensibility/680) with ease
- common building blocks to minimize code replication between extensions
- curating good first issues
- [contributor incentivization](https://forum.aragon.org/t/experimenting-with-bounties-using-the-projects-app/1016)
- clearer [priorities](https://github.com/orgs/aragon/projects/3)
- better communication of releases & priorities

Until next time, [happy hacking](https://hack.aragon.org/)!
